# Pinball-Challenge
This was inspired by Sarah Wang, who challenged me to build a pinball game using only graphics.py
Graphics.py is a basic python image library that we use at Carleton College for our python course 
CS 101: Intro to Computer Science. As a result the only way  to run this program is to use the
graphics.py file included in this repo. Without it, it won't work.
